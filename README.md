## Permissions

Explanation of why various permissions are needed:

The NFC permission is needed by the app so that it can locate your position on the event map thanks to our NFC tags and in order to give you the multimedia content the organizer has provided for the point of interest you have scanned. The permission also allow Arianna to automatically start when you scan one of our tags.
The Internet, Access and Change Network State and Wi-Fi State permissions are required  so that the app can connect to our event showcase when you want to navigate our event database, download events maps and the related information and dynamically fetch the content for the point of interest you are visiting. Arianna will use the Wi-Fi internet connection the event organizer has provided, unless you manually activate your data connection support (the option is turned off as default). Arianna will never try to use your data connection without your explicit permission.
The Get Tasks permission is needed to assure a logical navigation flow from the map and the info about what you are interested.
